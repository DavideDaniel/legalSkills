#Legal Skills

####The Meeting
* productive & engaging
* engaging is up to your charisma
* productive is about preparation
    - research (on who[client], what, why)
    - prep for discussion - lead the meeting
    - get a deliverable - THE PLAN (aka contract)

####The Email
* Recap: talk about what was discussed & agreement
* Answers: for any info you promised
* Next up: steps going forward

####The Negotiation
* Can be subtle & happen during the meeting while you're discussing details
* Other situations it can be back & forth on a few specific issues
    - focus on collaboration
    - don't say yes to everything but keep their perspective in mind & adjust
    - get info about their limits so you can adjust
* Prep
    - what do you want?
    - what you think they want?
    - prep several alternative scenarios
    - know your limits
* Offers & counteroffers
    - first offer should be the ideal offer
    - everything after the first offer is a counter offer
    - make the first offer - set the tone
    - don't counter your own offer - undermines you
* Closing the deal
    - 1 email that summarizes everything
    - include date/price/essential contingencies
    - make sure it's acknowledged
* Contracts
    - Know what you're saying
    - If doc is confusing - GET HELP
        - Use personal & professional connections
        - Bar association referral services
        - Seek out someone who you are comfortable with who has experience in your field
    - What to look for 
        + Date
        + Price
        + People involved
        + Correct Contact Info
        + Cancellation provisions
        + Responsibility for unforeseen costs/events

####Recap
* Preparation makes your life easier and you look good
* Setting the meeting agenda = control over how to reach agreement
* Restate the verbal agreement over email to solidify the agreement and holds everyone accountable
* Ultimately, a clear, written agreement is the easiest way to do business
    - Emails and paper trails show mutual understanding (not a contract if not signed, but powerful for courts)

####Bring it all together
* Certainty
* Clarity
* Accountability
